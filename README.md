# E-Commerce Test Automation Project (AutomationExercise.com)

This project demonstrates end-to-end test automation of an e-commerce website using **Selenium**, **Python**, and **Pytest**, following clean code principles and best practices.

## Project Highlights

  -  Automated test scenarios for Signup, Login, Checkout, and other key user flows.
  
  -  Follows Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable and reusable test code.
  
  -  Implements data-driven testing using Faker for random but realistic test data.
  
  -  Clean code structure: separation of test data, page objects, and test scripts.

## Test Coverage
  
This project covers key user flows of the e-commerce website, including:

**Signup & Account Creation**

- Registering a new user with complete personal and address details
  
- Handling duplicate email validation

**Login**

- Logging in with correct and incorrect credentials

- Validating input formats and required fields

**Product Interaction**

- Adding products to cart from the homepage

- Viewing the cart and verifying product details

**Contact Us**

- Submitting the contact form with valid information

**Checkout Process**

- Proceeding through the checkout flow with a registered user

- Verifying address information and confirming the order
  
  
## Tools & Tech Stack

Language: Python

  - **Test Framework:** Pytest

  - **Automation Tool:** Selenium WebDriver

  - **Data Generation:** Faker

  - **Reporting:** (Optional) Allure Report
  
  - **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern

## Learning & Contribution

This project was built as part of a self-learning journey in automation testing. The test scenarios were originally created manually and then automated with guidance and improvement using AI assistance. 

The goal was to:

  - Practice writing clean and maintainable automation code

  - Understand testing concepts like element locating, flow control, and validations

  - Build confidence in using Selenium and Pytest for real-world testing
